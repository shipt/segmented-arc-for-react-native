## Welcome

We are glad you are here! We think it's awesome that you want to spend time helping us make React Native Segmented Arc even better. We really value the community we get to be a part of, and we are grateful for your contribution.

Contribution requires signing a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) via HelloSign, a process automated as a part of a pull request. Your Github email address must match the email address used to sign the CLA. Github has [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github/) on setting email addresses. Your git email must also match this email address.

## How to Contribute to React Native Segmented Arc

The basic workflow:

1. You have an idea or see something that you want to fix, so ...
2. Fork React Native Segmented Arc.
3. Start a new branch for your feature.
   - Branch prefixes we use:
     - `feature/`: for features
     - `support/`: for general refactoring
     - `hotfix/`: something broke and we need to fix it now
4. Submit a Pull Request! Do it early and mark it `WIP` so a maintainer knows it's not ready for review just yet.
5. If you haven't signed our CLA before, then you will receive an email from HelloSign to sign the CLA.
   - The CLA request will be sent to the email address associated with your github account.
   - You cannot have your PR merged without signing the PR.
   - If you already submitted a PR and need to correct your user.name and/or user.email please do so and then use `git commit --amend --reset-author` and then `git push --force` to correct the PR.
6. Request review from one of our maintainers.
7. Get Approval. We'll let you know if there are any changes that are needed.
8. Boom! You can merge your changes into React Native Segmented Arc.
